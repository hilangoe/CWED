With the support of the Sudan and Saudi Arabia, EIJM formed in the early 1980s, in Gedaref, Sudan. The group was originally comprised of Islamist members of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), which had many of its senior members participate in the Soviet–Afghan War. Since its formation, a number of Islamist groups split from EIJM to form their own jihadi groups. Among the biggest split came from the Eritrean Islamic Salvation Movement (EISM), which left EIJM in 1998. EISM went on to gain Ethiopian support after it changed its name to the Eritrean Islamic Party for Justice and Development, a change critics say was Addis Ababa's poor attempt of putting lipstick on an Al-Qaeda pig. Eritrea, initially federated to Ethiopia in 1952 was thereafter annexed in 1962 by Ethiopia with the tacit complicity of the UN. All this was done without regard to the Eritrean people’s aspiration for self-determination. This led the Eritrean people to engage in a 30-year war with Ethiopia – what has been referred to as the “long struggle”. It was only in 1991 that Eritrea achieved independence and was recognized by the UN as an independent country in 1993. That same year, Isaias Afwerki was elected to office with almost unanimous majority as the President of the newly independent Eritrea. It is now 25 years since independence. Sadly, what had intended to be the beginning of peaceful relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea evolved instead into hostilities. In 1998, Eritrea and Ethiopia went to war in what is known as the Boundary War which lasted until the year 2000. A costly war, with substantive loss of lives on both sides, with Ethiopia suffering the heaviest of causalities. The Origins of the Border Conflict: To understand the origins and the nature of the conflict, one needs to look back in time to ascertain the intention and modus operandi of the actions and decisions that emanated in the attacks in 1998 and the ensuing border war. One must be aware that around this period, the bilateral ties between Eritrea and Ethiopia were close and cordial and it is therefore difficult to make sense of why the town of Badme in Eritrea, often cited as the casus belli, was relevant. It is only upon review of facts that one is made aware of Ethiopia’s concerted plan to alter the boundaries by laying new facts on the ground, including in Badme and Adi Murug and the unprovoked border skirmishes, as part of a complex, premeditated and centrally planned operation, that included the concerted engagement of external actors.",The dates of the civil war in Eritrea and the border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia clash. The border war began in 1998 and did not end until 2000. The civil war began and ended in 1999. It is difficult to tell exactly how Eritrea might have retaliated given that they were already in a war with Ethiopia at the time. ,1993-12-16,1997-06-30,1997-06-30,1993,12,16,1997,6,30,1997,6,30,222,"kv, hil",0

The Sudanese Minister of State declared that Sudan “would not hesitate to strike back.” He also claimed that Ethiopia was harboring rebels that launched attacks on Sudanese border villages. Ethiopian officials denied that its troops were at the border, and said that Sudan’s allegations were completely false. Because both states were involved in civil wars, Ethiopia’s actions were simultaneously an intervention and an externalization. We give this case a primary coding of intervention on the grounds that Ethiopia allegedly invaded in concert with Sudanese rebels. The secondary coding of externalization reflects the fact that both states took militarized action in order to coerce the other into ending support for rebels.
